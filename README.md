# Quicksort
Created quicksort in C and translated into Assembly

I have worked with many different osrting algorithms. Quicksort is a very good one, and a fun example of how creative we can get to sort groupings of items. This quicksort was made in C relatively simplisticly then in an attempt to learn how registers work within AMD64 Assembly, I translated the C code into Assembly. The Assembly code is a bit messy but it was my first attempt and works as expected.
